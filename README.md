    The next generation of the Challenge List website, made to suit the lively purposes of a growing community.
  <hr />
</div>

Welcome to the repository of the Challenge List Website! This is the core frontend of the actual website, and is where everything within it functions. Generally, this frontend is made *specifically* for the Challenge List, but you can use it for your own purposes if you'd like within the confines of what we (the Challenge List developers) allow you to do outside of the bounds of the current license. While we appreciate contributors and pull requests, we will not accept any requests that are not related to the Challenge List itself.

## Requirements
* Node.js v17.x or higher
* TypeScript v4.8.x or higher

## Contributions
All contributions and pull requsts are appreciated and welcome, but aspects of the Website are already designed with features in mind in proportion to the original Pointercrate backend. If you wish to work on new features or changes, please open an issue on our GitHub repository first to discuss the changes you wish to make and we will happily give you what is necessary to handle the addition of the feature.

### Support

All support for the Website is handled here on GitHub. If you have any questions, please open an issue and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

## License

challengelist/website is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license. Please see the license file for more information. Simply put, you are free to use this software for any purpose, but you must disclose any changes you make to the source code and release them under the same license. This however does not include branding or other assets that are not part of the source code; such as Challenge List logos, icons, etc.
